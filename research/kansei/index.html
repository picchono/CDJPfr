By reconstructing the historical path of kansei research and exploring the variety of disciplines within kansei research, I point out the opportunities for kansei design to emerge. Whereas kansei engineering and kansei science have found their roots in scientifically established approaches (respectively engineering and brain science), kansei design intends to return to earlier Japanese philosophical or cultural works to rediscover the essence of kansei, and to use them as inspirational means for design.

This quality of the field generates both a richness for the kansei disciplines, and a challenge to define its core term, kansei. Taking into consideration this richness and this challenge, I propose an original way to look at kansei studies, and to adopt a complex thinking approach to describe the dynamics of the field. Considering kansei studies as a complex unity helps to understand the impossibility of obtaining a common definition of kansei, and yet to stimulate necessary inter-disciplinary collaborations through dialogic. Kansei design is then taken as a starting point to exemplify such necessity and value of considering kansei studies as a complex unity. Proposing a kansei design framework inspired from Japanese philosophy and culture and centred on thusness and irregularity, the notion of appropriation appears to be a challenge both for kansei design and for the field of kansei studies at large. Studying appropriation through kansei studies in a dialogical way, will not only inform design on this challenging notion, but also help us to understand the benefit of considering kansei studies as a complex unity through practice.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/sketching-kansei-studies-as-a-complex-unit/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2023</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Sketching Kansei Studies as a Complex Unit</span></a></div><div class='publications it2 pack-item' aria-label="The Proceedings of the Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research International Conference 2022, KEER 2022" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2022-09-09 22:10:51 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2022-09-09 22:10:51 +0200 CEST The 9th International Conference on Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research (KEER2022) took place from 6 th to 8 th September 2022 (with an informal doctoral symposium the afternoon of 5 th September). The hosting city, Barcelona, is bathed by the Mediterranean Sea. Since ancient times, the Mediterranean has been a link between the East and the West, between the South and the North, and a way to share knowledge, technology and skills among very diverse peoples and cultures. Therefore, this edition of KEER revolved around the notion of diversities. Diversities of cultures, diversities of practices, diversities of perspectives, diversities of places, diversities of experiences. These diversities and their encounters are sources of richness. Understanding and experimenting with diversities in mind leads towards a greater comprehension of kansei. What we tried to do with the conference was encouraging discussion on the consideration of diversities as an encounter, bringing us together on the topic of kansei.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/kansei-engineering-and-emotion-research-2022/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2022</div></span><span class=boxTitle>The Proceedings of the Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research International Conference 2022, KEER 2022</span></a></div><div class='publications it3 pack-item' aria-label="Artefactual emptiness – On appropriation in kansei design" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2020-08-30 17:03:37 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2020-08-30 17:03:37 +0200 CEST Appropriation is the phenomenon by which an artefact is adapted for a specific use, distinct from the original design intention. By essence, it cannot be planned by design. However, it is a major aspect in the experience one may have in interaction with an artefact, as it leads to the feelings of ownership and to the effective situatedness of the artefact. It is therefore significantly contributing to designing for sustainability and for the everyday. This paper intends to address how design can consider the possibility of appropriation. Taking a kansei design approach, inspired from the nishidian philosophy on perception, we introduce the notion of artefactual emptiness as a space provided by design and left to the user to adapt the artefact for its integration in the habitability of the world. This space is made accessible and inviting by involving irregularities, suggested by Yanagi Soetsu as a means towards beauty, and implemented in design through micro-considerations and micro-frictions. Artefactual emptiness leads to beauty in experience, expected from a kansei perspective and made possible by kansei design. This work on appropriation through kansei design also leads to question the attention appropriation should have in other domains of kansei research, especially kansei evaluation. It calls for finding ways in kansei research to evaluate over time the kansei effect of appropriation on experience.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/artefactual-emptiness-on-appropriation-in-kansei-design/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2020</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Artefactual emptiness – On appropriation in kansei design</span></a></div><div class='publications it4 pack-item' aria-label="The Proceedings of the Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research International Conference 2018, KEER 2018" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2018-03-22 23:44:38 +0100 CET" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2018-03-22 23:44:38 +0100 CET The proceedings gather a selection of refereed papers presented at the 7th International Conference on Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research 2018 (KEER 2018), which was held in Kuching, Malaysia from 19 to 22 March 2018.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The contributions address the latest advances in and innovative applications of Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research.

However, not only primary controls remain the dominant artefact to interact with in the driving experience, but also distracted drivers (i.e., interacting with secondary controls or other artefacts while driving) are a major reason of accidents. In this paper, we introduce a design project on the steering wheel, taken from a kansei design perspective. Based on a kansei design framework, structured by three stages (Expression, Gesture, Affect), we observed the way drivers interact with various forms of steering wheel in order to create design propositions for greater and safer driving experiences in the context of novel driving conditions, i.e., with novel technologies and recent driving techniques.

The everyday is about what is banal, infraordinary, not memorable, as well as about the force that makes things habitual, endotic. In the research encompassing this paper, we question the everyday and explore opportunities to enchant it by design. This paper focuses more specifically on the design of everyday rituals, and aims to propose a descriptive framework to ‘read’ and compose such rituals. The elaboration of the framework is done based on a case study: the making of a hot chocolate in the morning. Through an autoethnographical approach, the main dimensions of the framework are determined (place and time, essentiality, and strength) and discussed. Throughout thizs inquiry, the value of a first-person perspective while designing for the everyday is discussed, as well as its relationship with the third- person perspective. This framework proposed points out the importance of quick iterations and of the consideration of consequences of design decision at all levels of the everyday ritual (structural, temporal, aesthetical, ethical…).</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/impact-of-perception-theories-on-kansei-design/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2014</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Impact of perception theories on kansei design</span></a></div><div class='publications it7 pack-item' aria-label="Perception Theories and Kansei Design" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2014-08-13 22:46:54 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2014-08-13 22:46:54 +0200 CEST Approaches to create artifacts taking kansei into consideration are multiple and are shared among various disciplines, such as kansei engineering, kansei science, and kansei design. In this paper, I focus on the discipline of kansei design and show that various approaches exist within this discipline. These can be characterized based on their focus: either the physical or the interactive materiality of the artifact. Indirect kansei design, mostly focusing on the physical materiality, is based on indirect (or mediated) perception theories. It often relies on representations, models, and metaphors to provide meaningful input to the design. Direct kansei design, mostly focusing on the interactive materiality, is based on direct (or ecological) perception theories. It mainly relies on the designerly attitude of the designer in the process, and apprehend design meaning to emerge from the reflection upon design exploration within the process. Describing and differentiating these two approaches show how kansei is considered differently by different approaches of kansei deign, looking forward a dialogue between these approaches in order to obtain a greater insight on kansei and on its consideration for designing.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/perception-theories-and-kansei-design/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2014</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Perception Theories and Kansei Design</span></a></div><div class='publications it8 pack-item' aria-label="Rite de transition – a design choreographic exploration of cultural value exchange, through development of intercultural ritual artefacts" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2014-08-13 22:41:15 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2014-08-13 22:41:15 +0200 CEST This research project is called Rite de transition. By means of DesignChoreography, an approach developed by Sietske Klooster, we explore the rituals revolving around traditional Turkish marriage. In due course, inspired by an emotional and auto-ethnographic interpretation of the explored rituals, Klooster designs a novel ritual and artefact that intend to embody shared values, hence intercultural exchange. We choose for a bodily first person approach as we estimate that the complexities of the modern world – i.e. cultural clashes and the breakdown of cultures – require a radical change in tackling these issues. We suggest to move away from pure rational analytic approach our society adhered to. We are on the verge of a new era that embraces diversity and organic interaction that cannot and does not have to be standardized, fixed or rigidly defined anymore. Our approach is based on embodiment and phenomenology, allowing us to diverge from narrowing down broad societal and cultural issues to mere rational thinking and judging. We use DesignChoreography as a vehicle, since the knowing and making body can experience meanings and values that lie underneath visual appearance. By doing so we bring about our bodily understanding for intercultural interaction and exchange.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/rite-de-transition/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2014</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Rite de transition – a design choreographic exploration of cultural value exchange, through development of intercultural ritual artefacts</span></a></div><div class='publications it9 pack-item' aria-label="Exploring constituents for kansei design, towards a framework" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2013-09-12 22:31:09 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2013-09-12 22:31:09 +0200 CEST Next to the well-developed and recognized kansei engineering and kansei science, the discipline of kansei design still appears as emerging and explorative.

In order to structure further the discipline, necessary for the creation of a robust and specific design framework, I describe the constituents of the discipline, i.e., the notions the designers should take into consideration to either describe and explore kansei through designing, or to reflect upon and validate kansei designs (especially interactivity aspects).

Passage est un projet réalisé en 2012 par Gracia Goh, Chiyong Lim, et Kate Vermeyen à l’Université de Technologie d’Eindhoven. Passage s’intéresse au lieu de transition entre deux espaces physiques, c’est-à-dire à leur entre-espace. L’énoncé du projet invite les étudiant à réaliser un design pour l’entre-espace en évitant d’influencer l’expérience de l’un des deux espaces. Cet énoncé semble a priori phénoménologiquement incohérent, puisque l’expérience d’une chose extérieure à soi a nécessairement lieu dans un espace et demande de plus que l’attention de l’utilisateur soit dirigée au moins partiellement vers cette chose. Or non seulement l’entre-espace ne semble pas être un espace (mais plutôt une surface), et l’attention d’une personne passant une porte est le plus souvent dirigée vers l’espace dans lequel elle compte se rendre.
Après de multiples itérations incluant des fabrications de prototypes, des essais en situation, des réflexions basées sur la contexture kansei, etc., un remarquable design a progressivement pris forme. Passage est une installation montée sur le cadre d’une porte. Cette installation est composée d’une ligne de diodes électroluminescentes (LEDs RGB) projetée sur une feuille d’aluminium fine qui réfléchit la lumière en direction de la porte une fois entrouverte. Les diodes changent très lentement la couleur émise. La feuille d’aluminium ondule en fonction de la manière dont la porte est ouverte : une ouverture franche créera bien plus de turbulences qu’une ouverture lente. L’impression lumineuse projetée sur la porte est donc unique à chaque ouverture et à chaque fermeture.
Ce qui est remarquable dans ce design est que la projection lumineuse n’est pas visible par le passant lorsque la porte est complètement fermée ou franchement ouverte, si bien que l’interaction n’a lieu que dans l’action de l’ouverture de la porte. L’expérience commence dès que l’on commence à ouvrir la porte et finit avant que l’on ait fini de l’ouvrir. Non seulement l’installation se trouve (quasiment) localisée dans cet entre-espace, mais l’expérience est également localisée dans cet entre-espace : elle n’interfère quasiment pas avec l’intentionnalité du passant de passer dans l’espace suivant. L’objectif du design est ainsi atteint.
Outre certains descripteurs kansei « classiques », tels que le grain, l’interaction lumière-ombre ou la sensation d’une invitation à apprécier cet entre-espace, des descripteurs kansei spécifiques à ce projet ont été établis : l’instantanéité et l’insaisissable, et plus encore leur couple. Ce qui est remarquable est que cette expérience est prenante du point de vue de son expression, engageante par le geste, et que son intensité vient du fait qu’elle est très courte, inéluctable, et insaisissable : en un instant elle nous engage puis nous libère, sans qu’on puisse vraiment y échapper, ni en faire quoi que ce soit. Là est la beauté de ce design.

The development of this method is itself a part of a series of design methods based on the collaboration of the research fields of psychophysiology and design. As case studies, two design projects following this process are introduced. Firstly, the colourful rain umbrella lets its user to experience grapheme-colour synaesthesia. Secondly, the sensorial socialising smartphone informs about the user?s digital social network activity by the means of warmth, a non-invasive tactile technique. Informed by psychophysiological literature, this design is shown to be not only informational of the network activity, but also motivational towards greater social experience. This approach enables psychophysiology not only to inform and support design ideation, but also to enrich the value of the design concept by bringing new arguments.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/involving-psychophysiological-knowledge-in-kansei-design/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2012</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Involving psychophysiological knowledge in Kansei design</span></a></div><div class='publications it14 pack-item' aria-label="When Movement Invites to Experience: a Kansei Design Exploration on Senses’ Qualities" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2012-04-14 22:03:51 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2012-04-14 22:03:51 +0200 CEST In this paper, we introduce a Research through Design on Sensual Dynamics, and explore four design projects (namely Be Touched!, Sound Flowers, Shylight, and Blow!) from which we extract design notions providing valuable insights on how to design with and for the senses’ quality ‘reciprocity’. ‘Sensual Dynamics’ designs are artifacts that are able to sense one person and to behave upon her presnece to invite for movements enhancing the perceptive experience.

We consider Making (synthesising and concretising) an essential activity of designers, prior to Thinking (analysing and abstracting), because only through experience – a result of acting in the world – we achieve meaning, funnelling human intentionality. Making enables designers to explore the unknown by trusting their senses and their kansei, exploring resistance and ambiguity and by tapping into their intuition. Because ‘intuition begins with the sense that what is not yet could be’, it involves skills, as skills are our way to make sense of the world, transform it and to cater for ethics. In this paper we describe a one-day workshop that has been held during the CHItaly conference 2011 in Alghero, Italy. During that day, we explored how the integration of points of view, using intuition through skills can communicate and create a richer meaning. The assignment was to design an empowering and enabling tool that allows a person to begin to experience another person’s skill. To be able to design such a tool, designers had to go through several steps of documenting and reflecting upon their own and each other’s skills. We reflect on the experience and explain how this approach can support the integration of points of view, which is considered to be formed by personal experience, by skills, and by kansei.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/developing-a-design-approach-exploring-resistance-and-ambiguity/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2012</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Developing a design approach, exploring resistance and ambiguity</span></a></div><div class='publications it16 pack-item' aria-label="Psychophysiological Applications in Kansei Design" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2011-09-23 15:21:00 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2011-09-23 15:21:00 +0200 CEST In order to describe emerging methods and means for Kansei design, this paper overviews three approaches involving an intense collaboration between the fields of design and psychophysiology:&lt;br/> - The use of tools built for psychophysiology and of techniques based on constructivist psychology theory, in order to support designers ‘inspirational work focusing on human beings’ behaviors, experience, and mental constructs.&lt;br/> - The use of knowledge created by psychophysiological research as an inspirational source of knowledge and as a conveyor of it for all along the design process.

Recently, this dualism in diverse direction is integrated in a notion of context, which had brought from social science as the manifest of implicit interactions that makes ‘sense’ from human actions or activities. In this research, we applied perception in ecological view to capture the stimuli of context in its dynamic nature, and proposed a notion of sensory function in extracting the transfer character of sensorimotor as transmitting signals to perception. Firstly, a theoretical approach in integrated context and perception was reviewed as the nature of stimuli and sensorimotor that can offer a grounded knowledge to carry images of context to perceptual actions. Secondly, we practiced a process in conductive way to analysis and synthesis the transfer function as a notion of sensory function. Thirdly, an application of prototype was built for order action that situated in a coffee shop, and implemented with a concept of ‘waiter cup’. To conclude, this study may be important to support incentive observation at the early design stage, and provides a tool to exploring contextual perception in designing interaction.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/developing-sensory-functions-transfer-human-senses-from-contextual-perception/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2010</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Developing sensory functions: Transfer human senses from contextual perception</span></a></div><div class='publications it21 pack-item' aria-label="Prospective psychophysiological approach for Kansei design: knowledge sharing between psychophysiology and design" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2009-09-22 21:28:01 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2009-09-22 21:28:01 +0200 CEST This paper introduces an interdisciplinary design method, based on psychophysiological knowledge used as inspirational means for Kansei design.

Little information is available, however, concerning the neuronal foundations of creativity. In this study, we introduced a new artistic task, designing a new tool (a pen), which let us quantitatively evaluate creativity by three indices of originality. These scores were analyzed in combination with brain activities measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results were compared between subjects who had been formally trained in design (experts) and novice subjects. In the experts, creativity was quantitatively correlated with the degree of dominance of the right prefrontal cortex over that of the left, but not with that of the right or left prefrontal cortex alone. In contrast, in novice subjects, only a negative correlation with creativity was observed in the bilateral inferior parietal cortex. We introduced structure equation modeling to analyze the interactions among these four brain areas and originality indices. The results predicted that training exerts a direct effect on the left parietal cortex. Additionally, as a result of the indirect effects, the activity of the right prefrontal cortex was facilitated, and the left prefrontal and right parietal cortices were suppressed. Our results supported the hypothesis that training increases creativity via reorganized intercortical interactions.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/neural-networks-involved-in-artistic-creativity/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2009</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Neural networks involved in artistic creativity</span></a></div><div class='publications it25 pack-item' aria-label="Lier Affectivité et Conception: l’Ingénierie Kansei" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2008-11-13 15:56:16 +0100 CET" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2008-11-13 15:56:16 +0100 CET L'intégration de caractéristiques subjectives relatives aux utilisateurs (telles que les émotions ou l'affectivité) est devenue une question majeure et internationale pour le développement de nouvelles techniques de conception de produits.

Finally, it will be suggested that Kansei research for design, which is at the origin of this research, can be a source of new development to improve the quality of human factors in EcoDesign.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/interdisciplinary-design-method-for-ecodesign-introducing-kansei-research-for-design-to-ecodesign/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2007</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Interdisciplinary Design Method for EcoDesign, Introducing Kansei research for design to EcoDesign</span></a></div><div class='publications it32 pack-item' aria-label="Creating an Evoked Metaphor for Kansei Design" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2007-06-29 17:35:41 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2007-06-29 17:35:41 +0200 CEST The Kansei design method allows interdisciplinary workgroups to process design projects using an original knowledge sharing system. This system is based on the SECI Model, already recognized as one of the most efficient models for creative projects. To minimize knowledge distortions due to the interdisciplinary quality of the workgroup, a tool called Evoked Metaphor is inserted to the SECI process. Thanks to the Evoked Metaphor, all shared knowledge can be understood intuitively by any member of the design workgroup, and can be validated on disciplinary points of view. This allows any member of the workgroup, regardless her/his own specialty, to participate to any step of the design process and to communicate with other members. This paper recalls the way the Evoked Metaphor can be used in the Kansei design process, and focuses on its construction method. To illustrate the construction process, an example is proposed concerning a car navigation project.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/creating-an-evoked-metaphor-for-kansei-design/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2007</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Creating an Evoked Metaphor for Kansei Design</span></a></div><div class='publications it33 pack-item' aria-label="Towards a definition of Kansei" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2006-09-29 19:13:29 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2006-09-29 19:13:29 +0200 CEST This paper introduces a new research aiming at defining the term Kansei using western philosophical concepts. In the literature, all definitions of the term Kansei are imprecise, even incorrect in most of the case. This is mainly due to the fact that Kansei is a Japanese term, which does not have direct translation in any western language. However, a deeper research has to be pursued to bring the research in Kansei, in Kansei Information, in Kansei Science, and so forth to an international level. This objective requires many research fields to meet in an interdisciplinary research environment following the example of previous works done in other fields, but also trying to link Japanese and Westerns concepts. This paper is an invitation for interested people to contact the research team.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/towards-a-definition-of-kansei/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2006</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Towards a definition of Kansei</span></a></div><div class='publications it34 pack-item' aria-label="Interdisciplinary workgroup methodology based on Intuition, Application to a communication tool design based on Kansei information approach" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2006-09-10 20:58:39 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2006-09-10 20:58:39 +0200 CEST The artifact is a complex element. Besides its elementary dimensions (material, functional and formal), the artifact is composed of much more dimensions: ergonomic, emotional, cultural, and even ethologic or theological. To take into account this great quantity and diversity of dimensions, the designer’s work has to be widened out. Necessarily, this goes through an interdisciplinary approach, i.e. through an interdisciplinary workgroup activity. Nevertheless, this brings issues, notably concerning knowledge communication and sharing. For each variety of knowledge (tacit, prescriptive and descriptive), interdisciplinary activity provokes issues either because of disciplinary ontology differences, or because of human subjective understanding differences. Intuition is a mental process which is able to minimize these issue effects. We then propose a methodology based on intuition, structured on the theory of Ba, on the SECI Model, which an evoked metaphor (EM) is added to. Through the EM, each member of the workgroup is able to participate to every steps of the design process and to communicate with other members, thanks to an intuitive understanding permanently validated by involved disciplines. This creates an efficient interdisciplinary dynamics and the realization of fully interdisciplinary projects. To illustrate this methodology, the design of MATiK is introduced as an example. MATiK is an original workgroup communication system based on a Kansei information approach. In order to understand the expected functionalities of MATiK and to design it, the EM is set up. Considering basic aspects of an extensive workgroup operative process, the Loft is defined as an EM. The Loft offers an opportunity to understand MATiK’s original functionalities, MATiK’s design, and MATiK’s functional and technical requirements intuitively. This methodology, based on the EM, asserts its relevancy for interdisciplinary design. Its strength comes from the fact that the EM links all the levels of the design process (the idea/concept level, the reality level, and the technical level) and makes their understanding accessible to all members thanks to intuition.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/interdisciplinary-workgroup-methodology-based-on-intuition-application-to-a-communication-tool-design-based-on-kansei-information-approach/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2006</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Interdisciplinary workgroup methodology based on Intuition, Application to a communication tool design based on Kansei information approach</span></a></div><div class='publications it35 pack-item' aria-label="MATiK, CMC design by Kansei Information approach" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2006-06-29 17:27:20 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2006-06-29 17:27:20 +0200 CEST In this paper, we introduce the work-in-progress of the design a CMC (Computer-Mediated Communication) system called MATiK. The originality of this design is not only the result, i.e. MATiK, but also the Kansei Information based design methodology used to design it. The later uses intuition as a knowledge-sharing process among the design workgroup members. An original conceptualizing tool (the Evoked Metaphor) is introduced in the paradigm of the sharing knowledge process (the SECI Model) to allow members of the interdisciplinary design workgroup to work together upon individual and disciplinary differences. MATiK includes an original function simulating the “cocktail party phenomenon” in the information flow management system of the CMC. This new function improves drastically the quality of social aspects of communications over computers by taking into considerations subjective and social aspects of all the users. Therefore, this paper proposes to discuss the implications of Kansei on sharing knowledge to overpass the current limits of the information technologies, before introducing MATiK and its design process.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/matik-cmc-design-by-kansei-information-approach/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2006</div></span><span class=boxTitle>MATiK, CMC design by Kansei Information approach</span></a></div><div class='publications it36 pack-item' aria-label="Kansei information approach for an interdisciplinary design method proposal based on intuition" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2006-04-29 17:14:53 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2006-04-29 17:14:53 +0200 CEST Considering the complexity of the artefact (artefact means here human construction, to be opposed with the Nature construction. It gathers objects, processes, services and their systems), great design improvements can succeed thanks to an interdisciplinary approach. However, interdisciplinary knowledge sharing encounters many issues, due to disciplinary ontology and human subjective understanding. For designers to adopt an interdisciplinary behaviour, a method is required.

The digital technology and the advent of the Internet are significant steps of this evolution. Nowadays, the impressive development and the intrusion of information technology at every level of the society, at the institutional levels as well as the private ones, bring the need for a new social and societal paradigm based on the knowledge and intelligence economy. This new paradigm includes the concept of Cyberspace to denote the virtual space for human and social exchanges based on human knowledge and experience. Each human being is a center of this paradigm. The individual, owner and retailer of intelligence, is emphasized by her/his own experience. Considering Chisei and Kansei, both cognitive elements of each individual, and descriptive and tacit knowledge, owned by each individual, there is a necessity to consider subjective (or personal) dimension in social communication while designing tools for the Cyberspace. The actual evolution, brought by the new information technologies, makes possible for each individual to share and announce one’s own knowledge with the rest of the group (by extension, with the whole humanity), whatever its size or nature. This is certainly a revolution. This is at the beginning of a new context allowing the design of relevant tools enable to help humanity to understand its common action. This understanding reaches to Collective Intelligence, a new opportunity for human community to progress. Thus there is a real need for new design objectives: creation of tools for Collective Intelligence. Kansei, translated in English as a mental sense of subjectivity, is influencing human relationships. It has an influence on both the ideation and the understanding of interpersonal communication. Thus, Kansei becomes a key point in social context behavior of each individual, influencing not only the social context it-self (its structure and its operation), but also the information flow. Therefore, Kansei Information can contribute to integrate human subjectivity aspects in the design of tools for the Collective Intelligence. Considering these points, the aim of this study is to understand how Kansei Information can contribute to the creation to the creation of a design methodology for Collective Intelligence, and thus to the improvement of communication structures of interdisciplinary workgroups.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/interdisciplinary-design-for-the-cyberspaceby-an-approach-in-kansei-information-methodology-and-workgroup-communication-tool-design-approach-in-kansei/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2006</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Interdisciplinary design for the cyberspace by an approach in kansei information, Methodology and Workgroup Communication Tool Design Approach in Kansei</span></a></div><div class='publications it38 pack-item' aria-label="Introducing MATiK service, Proposition for a new IT communication system through an approach in Kansei" data-cat-sort=1 data-date="2004-09-29 17:21:09 +0200 CEST" data-front=0 data-section=publications><div class="invisible abolute inline-block h-0 w-0 overflow-hidden">publications 2004-09-29 17:21:09 +0200 CEST Even though IT is a very convenient tool for virtual communities to correspond, limitations are many and, for most of them, already known. This paper focuses on the issues related with tacit knowledge and subjective communication. The aim is to introduce an original software taking user’s subjectivity into account to optimize information flow.&lt;br/>This research has been launch as a part of the 21st Century COE Program, sponsored by the MEXT, aiming at structuring Kansei as a science. Three laboratories with different specialties are working on this common program. As various knowledge is sharing between various people, a quick multiplication of mailing-lists occurred, creating a chaotic situation, preventing efficient communication. The wish to share knowledge (a fortiori tacit one) would fail if nothing was done.&lt;br/>MATiK is introduced as an original communication system satisfying determined requirements for optimized information sharing in an interdisciplinary workgroup. This introduction is done by pointing out the lack of currently existing systems: there is no consideration of the link between message content and user’s specificities. This link is shown as a solution for information flow optimization.&lt;br/>Then, a similarity concept, the loft, is introduced in order to explain the global operating procedure of MATiK, i.e. its information flow management. This ideation process, through highly subjective similarity concept, is favoring Kansei design approach. Next step of MATiK design will be presented in further publications.</div><a class="boxIso publications" href=https://chaire-design.fr/publications/introducing-matik-service-proposition-for-a-new-it-communication-system-through-an-approach-in-kansei/><span class=boxInfo><div class=font-bold>Publication</div><div>2004</div></span><span class=boxTitle>Introducing MATiK service, Proposition for a new IT communication system through an approach in Kansei</span></a></div></main></body></html>
